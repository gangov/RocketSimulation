In this project, you will build a simulation that will help us with our mission to Mars!

The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, but we need to run some simulations first to pick the correct fleet of rockets.

We've already designed 2 rocket prototypes, but we need your help to design and run some simulations to help us decide which type to use.
